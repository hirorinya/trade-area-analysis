# ðŸš¨ VERCEL ROOT DIRECTORY CONFIGURATION NEEDED

## The Problem
Vercel is trying to build from the project root, but our React app is in the `/frontend` subdirectory.

## Quick Fix (Do This Now!)

### In Vercel Dashboard:
1. Go to your project: **trade-area-analysis**
2. Click **Settings** 
3. Look for **Build & Development Settings** or **General**
4. Find **Root Directory** setting
5. Set it to: `frontend`
6. Click **Save**

### Alternative: Use Deploy Button
If you can't find Root Directory setting:
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click **Create Deployment**
3. Select branch: `staging`
4. Set **Root Directory**: `frontend`
5. Click **Deploy**

## What This Does
- Tells Vercel that our app is in the `frontend/` folder
- Makes `frontend/index.html` findable
- Uses `frontend/package.json` for build commands
- Uses `frontend/vercel.json` for configuration

## Current Issue
Right now Vercel is running:
```
cd frontend && npm run build
```
But it's looking for `index.html` in the wrong place.

## After Setting Root Directory
Vercel will run from `/frontend` as if it's the project root:
```
npm run build  # (already in frontend directory)
```

## Verification
After making this change, you should see:
- New deployment starting automatically
- Build succeeding (no more "index.html not found" error)
- Production site updating with v1.0.0

The code is 100% ready - just need this one Vercel setting!
