# ðŸš€ Deploy to Production - Instructions

## The Issue
Vercel is treating all branches equally and not distinguishing between staging and production deployments. We need to manually trigger a production deployment.

## Solution: Create a Deploy Hook

### Step 1: Create Deploy Hook in Vercel
1. In the screenshot you shared, under **Deploy Hooks** section
2. Click **Create Deploy Hook** (or similar button)
3. Fill in:
   - **Name**: `Production Deploy`
   - **Branch**: `main`
4. Click **Create**
5. Copy the webhook URL that appears

### Step 2: Trigger Production Deployment
Once you have the deploy hook URL, you can trigger it by:

**Option A: Using curl (easiest)**
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.vercel.com/v1/integrations/deploy/[YOUR-DEPLOY-HOOK-ID]
```

**Option B: Using browser**
- Simply paste the deploy hook URL in your browser and it will trigger

**Option C: From this terminal**
If you share the deploy hook URL, I can trigger it for you.

## Alternative Solution: Direct Deployment

If Deploy Hooks don't work, try this:

1. Go to your project's main page on Vercel
2. Look for a **Deployments** tab
3. Find the latest commit from `main` branch (should be "4d6deb1")
4. Click on it
5. Look for options like:
   - "Promote to Production"
   - "Visit"
   - "Redeploy"

## What's Currently in Main Branch

The `main` branch has ALL the production-ready features:
- âœ… v1.0.0 release
- âœ… Demo mode fully working
- âœ… All bug fixes from staging
- âœ… Production configuration
- âœ… 32,173 Tokyo census mesh cells
- âœ… Cross-browser compatibility

## Quick Check
Visit these URLs to see which is currently deployed:
- Production URL: https://trade-area-analysis-2png.vercel.app
- Check if it shows v1.0.0 in the console or network tab

The code is 100% ready - we just need Vercel to deploy from the main branch!
