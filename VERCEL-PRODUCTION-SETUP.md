# üö® URGENT: Vercel Production Setup Required

## The Problem
Vercel is currently **only deploying from the `staging` branch**, not from `main`. This is why you're not seeing production deployments.

## Quick Fix (Do This Now!)

### Option 1: Via Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on the `trade-area-analysis` project
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Git**
4. Under **Production Branch**, change from `staging` to `main`
5. Click **Save**
6. Go to **Deployments** tab
7. Find the latest commit on `main` branch (53fed9e or 2b5b85f)
8. Click the **...** menu ‚Üí **Promote to Production**

### Option 2: Via Vercel CLI (if you have access)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Link the project
vercel link

# Deploy to production from main branch
vercel --prod
```

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Code is merged to main branch
- ‚úÖ All features are production-ready
- ‚úÖ Vercel configuration is updated
- ‚ùå Vercel dashboard still points to staging branch

## After Fixing
Once you change the production branch to `main`, Vercel will:
1. Automatically deploy from main branch
2. Show production deployments in the dashboard
3. Update the production URL: https://trade-area-analysis-2png.vercel.app

## Why This Happened
The project was initially set up with `staging` as the production branch for safety. Now that we're ready for production, we need to update this setting in Vercel's dashboard.

## Need Help?
If you can't access the Vercel dashboard, you may need to:
1. Ask the project owner to update the settings
2. Or provide Vercel CLI access credentials

The application is **100% ready for production** - we just need to tell Vercel to deploy from the right branch!
